Types of Functions in Python

• Built-in functions, such as help() to ask for help, min() to
get the minimum value, print() to print an object to the
terminal.

• User-Defined Functions (UDFs), which are functions that
users create to help them out; and

• Anonymous functions, which are also called lambda
functions because they are not declared with the
standard def keyword.
